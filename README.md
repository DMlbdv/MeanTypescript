# MeanTypescript
Mean (Mongo, Angular, Express Node) Stack in Typescript. 
This a simplified version of a production app I wrote for my company.

There are multiple versions of this app.
The original is [here](https://github.com/mgbee8/activity_tracker_original).
This is AngularJS with OData backend (because I could). Application demonstrates validation in Angular 1.3 etc.

A MEAN version in [Javascript](https://github.com/mgbee8/activity_tracking).

And now a typescript MEAN version in this repository. Next steps will be to make the node backend and angularjs app more unit testable.
